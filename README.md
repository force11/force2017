# About

This repository has been set up to help plan the [FORCE 2017 Conference](https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2017) on 25-27 October 2017 in Berlin. 

For the moment, the most important things are the [open issues](https://github.com/force11/force2017/issues), to which you are invited to contribute. So far, the repo is used only by the [Program Committee](https://www.force11.org/group/force2017-organizing-committee/program-committee), but since its activities partially overlap with that of the others, tags for all five committees exist and have begun to be populated:
- [steering](https://github.com/force11/force2017/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Asteering);
- [sponsoring](https://github.com/force11/force2017/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Asponsoring);
- [program](https://github.com/force11/force2017/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aprogram%20);
- [outreach](https://github.com/force11/force2017/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aoutreach%20);
- [logistics](https://github.com/force11/force2017/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Alogistics).
