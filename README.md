# About

This repository has been set up to help plan the [FORCE 2017 Conference](https://www.force11.org/meetings/force2017) on 25-27 October 2017 in Berlin.

For the moment, the most important things are the [open issues](https://github.com/force11/force2017/issues), to which you are invited to contribute.
